Head Tracking with webcam
=========================

This little python script uses your webcam to track the position of your head in front of the screen, changing the perspective on a simple OpenGL scene accordingly.
This *should* fool the user's brain (if provided), and give him the sense of perspective.
If not, I suggest you to experiment with Alcohol.

Dependencies
------------

This script needs (obviously) the openCV python bindings (I used v. 2.3 of OpenCV) and [pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/) as my python openGL binding of choice.
